Strengths:

- Relevant problem that some of us in the group have struggled with before.
- Clear reporting on current issues.

Areas for Improvement:

- Evaluation metric may not be totally sound.
- Reward function is definitely not sound and we will have to mess with it more.

Critical Risks:

- The model not learning at all. Currently we have not been able to get it to properly learn and not just hallucinate.

Concrete Next Actions:

- First priority is fixing the model training.
  
Resources Needed:

- See if the new Google Cloud credits can be used for Colab as the A100 we're using is $1/hr
