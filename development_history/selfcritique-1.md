Strengths:

- Relevant real-world problem, could be high impact if done correctly
- Good analysis of constraints

Areas for Improvement:

- Could use more concrete experimentation and results (time-limited)
- Evaluation metric could contain some bias in it

Critical Risks:

- Training time/credits. Currently taking an unrealistic amount of time for training, but it is a relatively big model. We are assuming using a smaller model will keep enough accuracy while shortening training times.

Concrete Next Actions:

- Get the notebook running locally on faster GPUs, or get Colab Pro for access to the A100 GPU
- Discuss evaluation metric with professor and adjust it to reduce bias as needed

Resources Needed:

- We may need more computing power either via local or cloud GPU. We will also have to expand our knowledge base around reasoning models as none of us have worked with them before.
