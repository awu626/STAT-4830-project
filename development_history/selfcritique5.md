Strengths:

- Much clearer path forward than during the previous report.
- SymPy should provide mathematical reliability that is not subject to hallucinations (ie, if the LLM messes up it will likely output an invalid formula, which would cause SymPy to fail and not output anything rather than just report the wrong answer). This is preferable behavior to the alternative.

Areas for Improvement:

- Make the regex expression a bit more robust so it can't get tripped up by small formatting errors.
- Make more progress on the training aspect of it, there is a good framework but limited results.

Critical Risks:

- Unsure if text-to-text transformations are going to be more difficult for the LLM or require more data.

Concrete Next Actions:

- First priority is fixing the model training.
  
Resources Needed:

- None currently. Pending more data later if needed.
